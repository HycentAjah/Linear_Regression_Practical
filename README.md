# Linear_Regression_Practical
## Linear Regression
In this practical, we will perform a linear regression analysis on CO2 Emissions to understand the drivers for CO2 emissions, that is, we predict the CO2 Emission of a car based on the features of the car.

The steps in the practical include:

1. Loading the required libraries
2. Reading and exploring the dataset
3. Data cleaning
4. Exploratory data analysis
5. Modelling
6. Model evaluation
7. ML pipeline
8. Cross validation
9. Regularization
   
### The data for this practical was obtained from the IBM cloud storage.
